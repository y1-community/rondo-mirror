// The stock firmware's root backdoors (docs/device/README.md): Innioasis's firmware, and so the base ROM
// every Rondo firmware is made from, runs zxly's agent (aggdll, init's aggsrv: a hidden su and a silent
// app installer), the downloader it drops (wifi_init: a file downloaded and run as root) and SPWall
// (libsp.so, init's spwall: commands run as root for other programs). firmware/build.sh leaves them
// out of the firmware since 3.0, and Rondo 3.0 needs that firmware (kFirmwareNeeded 3); should a Rondo run on
// an older one anyway (a bundle put on by hand), it takes them out itself.
