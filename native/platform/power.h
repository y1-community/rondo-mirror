// Screen off is two stages: the backlight off and no drawing (a key brings it back at once), then early
// suspend ("mem" to /sys/power/state), whose handlers include the display: the kernel waits for the
// drawer to stop (it reads /sys/power/wait_for_fb_wake once wait_for_fb_sleep has returned, and that
// read blocks until late resume lets drawing start again). With no wakelock held the kernel then
// suspends fully; a Power press wakes it ("on"), the panel back 0.54 s later.

// (598 MHz idle, 1.0 GHz busy), and stops USB pinning the top clock. cpuBoost(true) holds the clock
// at the top for motion, video and scans (no ramp-up in the first frames of a slide); false gives the
// governor back its say. cpuBothCores(true) keeps the second core in: the governor
