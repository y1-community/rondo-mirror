// Pictures: JPEG (libjpeg-turbo, decoded straight at 1/2 to 1/8 scale when that still covers the
// target) and PNG, scaled with an area filter to cover the target size, center-cropped, as RGBA.
//
// Decoding runs in a helper process with its own address space. Measured in N1: page faults and large
// allocations on threads of the render process hold its memory-map lock, which the Mali driver needs at
// the start of every frame, and frames then waited 50 ms to 2 s. In another process the same work costs
// the render process nothing. The pixels come back through shared memory mapped once at startup.
