// The picture of a video (the video renderer of 1.0.x's ExoPlayer), in rondo-player. The server's
// /s/<id>/<itag> (one of YouTube's H.264 DASH streams, through HttpSource) or a file on the card is read
// ahead by FFmpeg on one thread; another feeds MediaTek's hardware decoder through the native MediaCodec
// and renders each picture into the drawing process's VideoSurface when the sound reaches it.
//
// The sound is the engine's: a video's audio (/s/<id>/140) plays exactly like a song, and the picture
// follows its clock, so it pauses, buffers and seeks with it.
//
// The clock runs on across repeats (Shorts loop, as does any video with Repeat on): each pass of the
// sound starts at a time the engine names with loop(), and the reader, at the stream's end, goes back
// to its start with the pictures' times moved on by as much, so the decoder never stops.
