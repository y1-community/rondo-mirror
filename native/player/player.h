// The player (PlayerService and LocalAudioEngine in 1.0.x), natively: a process of its own,
// rondo-player, forked at startup like rondo-media. It decodes with FFmpeg (LGPL, shared libraries),
// resamples to 44.1 kHz stereo and plays through OpenSL ES. The next track is decoded ahead and joined
// in the same stream, so songs follow each other without a gap.
//
// The UI sends commands over a socket; the player publishes its state in shared memory that the UI
// reads every frame without a system call.
//
// 1.0.x's rules: a queue in an order (shuffle puts the current song first and shuffles the rest);
// repeat off, all or one; Previous goes back to the start after 3 s, else to the previous song; a
// seek stops 1 s before the end; Play next and Add to queue; a file that can't be played is skipped.
