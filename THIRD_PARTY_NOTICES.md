## In the server

## In the firmware (`rom.zip`)

The firmware is built from the y1-community's [Android 4.2 base ROM](https://github.com/y1-community/y1-ata-rom)
(`firmware/build.sh` downloads it): Android 4.2.2 from the Android Open Source Project (mostly
Apache-2.0) with the Y1's MediaTek drivers and system files as Innioasis shipped them. Rondo takes
apps out of it and adds its own; it redistributes the rest unchanged, as the base ROM does.
