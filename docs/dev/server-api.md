# Rondo server admin

The optional Rondo server's admin page, at `<server>/admin`: set up a fresh server, sign in its
YouTube account (with a code, or cookies.txt), connect the one Rondo device, keep yt-dlp current,
see what went wrong. Served by the server itself (any time, from any browser), in the same look as
the device and its dashboard (`docs/dev/dashboard-api.md`). It works over `http://` (at home, by
IP) and `https://` (on a VPS behind Caddy), and pairs **one device with one token**. This page
describes how it works, its API and the routes the Rondo itself calls besides browsing and
streams; for setting a server up, see [docs/server.md](../server.md).

A Rondo set to **Directly to YouTube** uses none of this: its own YouTube client
(`native/direct/`) answers the same device API on the Y1 (`127.0.0.1:47811`), so the screens ask
the same paths either way.

## How it fits together

- **First run:** no admin password yet. The server prints a one-time **setup code** in its log
  (`docker logs rondo`): `Rondo setup: open <base>/admin and enter 482-913`. The page asks for that
  code and a new admin password (at least 10 characters). The code changes on every restart until
  setup is done.
- **Admin sign-in:** password → session cookie `rondo_admin` (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Secure
  when the request came over HTTPS), 12 h. 5 wrong passwords a minute → `429`.
- **The device token:** one at a time. The admin page creates a 6-digit **connect code** (10
  minutes, one use). On the Rondo, Settings › YouTube › Connection › Connect to a server (or the dashboard's YouTube
  page) takes the server address and that code; the Rondo calls `POST /device/pair` and keeps the
  token it gets back. Pairing replaces the previous
  token (the old device stops working). "Disconnect" removes it.
  - Existing installs: until a device is paired through the admin page, the `API_TOKEN` from the
    environment (if set) is the device token, so the current Y1 keeps working. The first pairing or
    Disconnect retires it for good (`envRetired` in `/data/config.json`).
- **YouTube account (optional):** without one, YouTube and YouTube Music run signed out and the
  Rondo hides Library, Subscriptions and History (`GET /healthz` → `"account": {"music": bool,
  "videos": bool}`). **Sign in with a code** (smart-TV style, `server/src/tv.ts`): the page shows a
  code, the owner enters it at google.com/device; the OAuth tokens live in
  `/data/secrets/tv-oauth.json` (0600) and renew themselves. YouTube accepts them only from its TV
  client, so they serve YouTube home / subscriptions / history and the account's playlists and
  liked music; YouTube Music's own home and history still need cookies.txt. Signed out, YouTube's
  home mixes the TV app's topic pages (music, gaming, news, sports), since its own home is empty and
  Trending is gone.
- **Forgotten admin password:** remove `adminHash` from `/data/config.json` and restart; the log
  shows a new setup code (`docs/server.md` has the command). The device stays connected.
- **http and https:** the server speaks plain HTTP on port 3000. On a VPS, Caddy in front adds
  HTTPS (with the Android 4.2 cipher settings, see `infra/Caddyfile`). At home, the Rondo can use
  `http://<server-ip>:3000` directly; the admin page and the dashboard mark such a connection
  "not encrypted: use it only on your home network".
- Settings are kept in `/data/config.json` on the server's volume (admin password hash, device
  token hash, pairing time, last seen). Secrets are never returned by any endpoint.

## Guessing limits

| What | Limit |
|---|---|
| Admin password (sign-in, password change) | 5 wrong a minute per address; 30 wrong an hour from all addresses together → `429` until the oldest one ages out (a restart clears it) |
| Setup code (fresh server) | the same, plus: 5 wrong codes from anywhere → a new code in the log and a minute's pause |
| Connect code (`POST /device/pair`) | 10 minutes, one use; 5 wrong tries cancel it |
| Device token, admin session | 256-bit and 192-bit random: nothing to guess, no limit |
| Rondo dashboard pairing code (on the device, port 8080) | 5 wrong → a new code on the screen and a 30 s pause for everyone (`429`); wrong guesses don't keep the dashboard from its 15-minute idle stop |

## Admin API (JSON; errors `{"error": "<reason>"}`)

Paths under `/admin/api`. Everything except `state`, `setup`, `login` needs the admin session
(`401 {"error": "signin"}` otherwise → the page shows sign-in).

- `GET /admin/api/state` → `{"setup": true | false, "signedIn": true | false, "https": bool, "version": "1.0.2"}`
  (no sign-in needed; the page watches `version` change while the server updates itself)
  (`setup: true` = no admin password yet).
- `POST /admin/api/setup` `{"code": "482913", "password": "…"}` → `{"ok": true}` and signs in.
  `403 {"error": "code"}`, `400 {"error": "password"}` (too short), `409` if already set up.
- `POST /admin/api/login` `{"password": "…"}` → `{"ok": true}`; `403 {"error": "password"}`,
  `429 {"error": "wait", "retryAfterSec": n}`.
- `POST /admin/api/logout` → `{"ok": true}`
- `POST /admin/api/password` `{"current": "…", "next": "…"}` → `{"ok": true}` with a new session cookie;
  every other session is signed out. `403`/`400`, `429` like sign-in.
- `GET /admin/api/status` →
  ```json
  {"server": {"version": "1.0.0", "uptimeSec": 5400, "https": true},
   "ytdlp": {"version": "2026.10.29.232701", "lastResolveOk": true},
   "cookies": {"present": true, "signedIn": true, "account": {"name": "Alex", "handle": "@alex"} | null,
               "checkedAt": 1793449000000 | null},
   "device": {"paired": true, "source": "paired" | "env" | null, "name": "Rondo" | null, "pairedAt": 1793440000000 | null,
              "lastSeenAt": 1793449100000 | null, "lastIp": "203.0.113.…" | null, "userAgent": "Rondo/1.0.0 …" | null},
   "pairing": {"code": "123456", "expiresAt": 1793449600000} | null,
   "updates": {"server": {"version": "1.0.1", "url": "https://github.com/…", "publishedAt": …} | null,
               "ytdlp": {"version": "2026.11.01.233542", "url": "…", "publishedAt": …} | null, "checkedAt": … | null}}
  ```
  `updates` names only releases newer than what runs (`server/src/updates.ts`): the latest Rondo release
  (from the update page's `latest.json`) and yt-dlp's latest nightly (from GitHub), asked at most every
  6 hours in the background.
  `UPDATE_CHECK=0` in the environment turns that off.  `signedIn` is null when not checked yet; the server checks after a cookies upload and every
  15 minutes.
- `POST /admin/api/cookies` with the cookies.txt **text as the body** (`Content-Type: text/plain`,
  at most 1 MB) → `{"ok": true, "signedIn": bool, "account": {…} | null}`;
  `400 {"error": "format"}` when it is not a Netscape cookies file with youtube.com cookies.
- `DELETE /admin/api/cookies` → `{"ok": true}` (YouTube Music home/library/history stop working).
- `POST /admin/api/cookies/check` → `{"signedIn": bool, "account": {…} | null}`
- `POST /admin/api/ytdlp/update` → `{"ok": true, "before": "…", "after": "…"}` (up to ~2 min).
- `GET /admin/api/server/update` → `{"available": true, "state": "idle" | "pulling" | "restarting" | "updated" | "current" | "failed", "message": "…", "at": ms}`,
  or `{"available": false}` without the updater container (`src/serverUpdate.ts`). `POST` the same path to
  start an update: `{"ok": true}`, `409 {"error": "busy"}` while one runs, `503 {"error": "unavailable"}` without
  the updater. The server then restarts on the new image and everyone signs in again.
- The updater itself (`src/updater/main.ts`, reachable only on the compose network, every call with
  `Authorization: Bearer <the token in /run/updater/token>`): `GET /v1/status` → `{state, message, at, target}`,
  `POST /v1/update` → `202 {"started": true}` or `409` while busy.
- `POST /admin/api/ytdlp/test` → `{"ok": true, "ms": 1840}` or `{"ok": false, "error": "…"}`
  (resolves a known video).
- `POST /admin/api/device/code` → `{"code": "123456", "expiresAt": …}` (replaces an unused one).
- `DELETE /admin/api/device/code` → `{"ok": true}` (cancel).
- `DELETE /admin/api/device` → `{"ok": true}` (disconnect: the token stops working).
- `POST /admin/api/tv` → `{"url": "https://www.google.com/device", "code": "ABC-DEF-GHI", "expiresAt": …}`
  (a new code; replaces a waiting one; `502 {"error": "google"}` when Google gives none). The
  approval arrives in `status.tv`: `{"signedIn": bool, "account": {"name", "handle"} | null,
  "pending": {url, code, expiresAt} | null, "error": "denied" | "expired" | "revoked" | "failed" | null}`.
- `DELETE /admin/api/tv/code` → `{"ok": true}` (cancel; an approval that still arrives is revoked).
- `DELETE /admin/api/tv` → `{"ok": true}` (sign out: tokens deleted and revoked at Google).
- `GET /admin/api/logs` → `{"lines": [{"time": 1793449000000, "level": "warn" | "error", "msg": "…"}]}`
  (the last 100 warnings and errors, newest first, no secrets).

## Device pairing (called by the Rondo, not the admin page)

- `POST /device/pair` `{"code": "123456", "name": "Rondo"}` → `{"token": "<64 hex>"}`;
  `403 {"error": "code"}` (wrong or expired; 5 wrong tries cancel the code). No auth header.


## Software updates for the Rondo (device token)

Rondo 1.0.x asks its server for updates. Rondo 2.0 asks GitHub itself, server or not: its own
YouTube client answers the same two routes on the Y1 from the update page
(`native/direct/routes.cpp`). The server keeps them for 1.0.x, and so that a 1.0.x Rondo hears of
2.0.

- `GET /update?firmware=<n>` → `{"version": "2.0.0", "size": 9437184, "notes": "<release page>", "firmware": 2}`
  for the newest Rondo release on the update page (`jarvissax.github.io/rondo/latest.json`, out once
  the release's `rom.zip` is built), or `{"version": null}`. The device compares it with its own version
  (Settings › Software update). `firmware` in the query is the device's firmware number
  (`ro.rondo.firmware`): 1 hears of the release's APK, 2 and up of its signed bundle. A release whose
  `firmware` is higher installs only with Innioasis Updater CE, and the device says so instead of
  offering it (`size` is then 0 when there's nothing it could install). Without the query (Rondo
  1.0.0, from before firmware numbers) only releases for firmware 1 are named.
- `GET /update/rondo.rondo` → the release's signed bundle (the update page's `rondo.rondo`), passed
  through as it downloads. Rondo installs it only when it's signed with the bundle key.
- `GET /update/rondo.apk` → a 1.0.x release's APK (the update page's `rondo.apk`), passed through
  as it downloads (`application/vnd.android.package-archive`), so a 1.0.x Y1 never talks to anyone
  but its server. Android on the Y1 installs it only when it's signed with the same key as the
  firmware's Rondo.

## Headphone match for the Rondo (device token)

Settings › Sound › Headphone match (`server/src/eq.ts`): AutoEq's parametric corrections, fetched
by the server from GitHub (the index once a day, a model once a week). Direct mode has no such
route: it answers `503 {"error": "needs_server"}`.

- `GET /eq/search?q=<model>` → `{"items": [{"id", "name", "source"}]}`, at most 20, best first;
  `502` when AutoEq's index didn't load.
- `GET /eq/preset?id=<id>` → `{"id", "name", "source", "preampDb", "filters": [{"type": "PK" | "LSC" | "HSC" | "LPQ" | "HPQ", "freq", "gainDb", "q"}]}`;
  `404` for an unknown model. An id is the model's folder under AutoEq's `results/`.

## Time zone for the Rondo (device token)

- `GET /timezone` → `{"timezone": "Europe/Lisbon"}`, or `{"timezone": null}` when no lookup service could
  tell. The zone of the public address the request came from (`X-Forwarded-For` behind a proxy),
  asked of ipwho.is, then ipapi.co; a private address (a Rondo on the server's network) is looked up
  by the server's own public address. Kept 12 hours per address (a miss 10 minutes). Rondo 2.0 asks
  once per Wi-Fi connection and sets the zone when its firmware's tzdata has it. Directly to
  YouTube, the Y1's own client asks the same two services itself.

## Subtitles for the Rondo (device token)

- `GET /captions/:id` → `{"tracks": [{"id", "lang", "name", "auto"}]}`: the video's own subtitle
  tracks (`id` = the language) and the speech recognition's in the language spoken (`id` =
  `<lang>.auto`), from yt-dlp's resolve. YouTube's machine translations are left out (Google answers
  them from a server with 429).
- `GET /captions/:id/:track` → `text/vtt`: that track as WebVTT, fetched from YouTube when asked.
  Direct mode on the Y1 answers the same two routes itself (`native/direct/streams.cpp`).
