#
#   firmware/build.sh path/to/rondo-X.rondo [firmware/out/rom.zip]
#
# Rondo (a bundle from tools/native/bundle.sh) runs without Android's Java layer: no app is left in
# /system/app, Rondo goes in as /system/rondo, and the boot image's init.rc starts it instead of zygote
# (tools/firmware/BootImage.java); SurfaceFlinger only sets the panel up, then firmware/rondo/start stops
# it. The boot logo shows until Rondo's first frame.
#
# It starts from the community's base ROM (stock Android 4.2.2 with the Y1's radios enabled) and
# takes out everything that isn't Rondo or Android's own background services: Rockbox, the stock
# Innioasis player, the Rockbox/stock switching scripts, every Android app, and the stock
# firmware's root backdoors (zxly's aggdll and wifi_init, SPWall). Rondo goes in as
# /system/rondo, so the Y1 boots straight into it. The images are edited in place with debugfs, so no mounting or root is needed.
#
# Needs curl, unzip, zip, java (17+) and e2fsprogs (debugfs, e2fsck):
#   macOS: brew install e2fsprogs        Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install e2fsprogs

# AndroidBoot.ttf, its state file; mp, aggdll's hidden copy of pm; SPWall (libsp.so), a service that
# runs commands as root for other programs, with its tools (libwp.so, a packet filter; libld.so, a
# code injector; libip.so, a renamed iptables; nothing starts them); the stock firmware's
# distribution tag (/system/channel/qbchannel.ini); and the paths the same family writes its
# downloads and helpers to. native/services/base_rom.cpp removes the same list from firmwares
